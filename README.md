All you need to do is add the action to your repo via a workflow via `pb33f/vacuum-action@v2`

Here are the configurable properties you can use in your workflow:

| Property         | Type      | Required | Description                                                                                                                    |
|------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `openapi_path`   | `string`  | **true** | The path to your OpenAPI spec file, relative to the root of your repository.                                                   |
| `github_token`   | `string`  | **true** | The GitHub token to use for authentication. This is required to post comments on pull requests.                                |
| `ruleset`        | `string`  | _false_  | The path to a custom ruleset file, relative to the root of your repository. If not provided, the default ruleset will be used. | 
| `show_rules`     | `boolean` | _false_  | If set to `true`, the action will show the rules that were applied. Defaults to `false`                                        |
| `fail_on_error`  | `boolean` | _false_  | If set to `true`, the action will fail if any errors are detected in the OpenAPI spec. Defaults to `true`                      |
| `minimum_score`  | `number`  | _false_  | The minimum score required to not fail the check. Defaults to `70`.                                                            |
| `print_logs`     | `boolean` | _false_  | If set to `true`, the action will print the markdown report to the runner logs. Defaults to `true`                             |
